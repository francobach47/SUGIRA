<b>SUGIRA (Sea Urchin Grapher - Impulse Response Ambisonic)</b> is a software for visualizing Ambisonics impulse responses in 3D. It allows you to export data related to Azimuth, Elevation, Intensity, and the W channel over time. Additionally, it features a section where you can load a plan image and overlay the hedgehog plot on it, resize it, and rotate it to align the direct sound with the direction of the source in the three planes.
